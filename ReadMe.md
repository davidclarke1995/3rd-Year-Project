## Introduction 

This is the 3rd year group project developed by David Clarke, Gary Connelly and Eoghan O'Connor. It is a group messenger app. Users can create a username and password and send private messages or send out a status in the form of a broadcast message for anyone to see. The clients can send a message to the server and the server sends it back out. The server is in a virtual machine in Google Cloud.

## System Requirements

### Purpose
The purpose of the System Requirements document is to specify the overall system requirements that will govern the development and implementation of the system.  The document will also establish initial security, training, capacity and system architecture requirements, as well as, system acceptance criteria agreed upon be the project sponsor and key stakeholders.

### Major System Conditions
- System uses eclipse
- System uses a virtual machine for the server
- System requires normal internet connection

### System Interface

System uses JFrame Java Platform that adds support for the JFC/Swing component architecture

## Installation
### From Github
If you are downloading this project from get hub, you will need a desktop/ laptop and a java IDE.
- In command prompt, navigate to wherever you would like the project to be save on your machine. 
- Type in the following command: 

```
https://github.com/davidclarke1995/3rd-Year-Project.git
```
Alternatively you can select this green button

- Open the project is your preffered java IDE.
- Navigate to the client project, and then to StartUpWindow class. 
- Click run. 
* If you cannot connect to the server this may be because my google cloud server has expired. However you can make your own server with the code in the server project, but you will need to create your own database locally. All the code for that can also be found on this repository under the DatabaseInterface folder.
