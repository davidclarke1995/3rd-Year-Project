# 3rd-Year-Project

## Introduction

This is the 3rd year group project developed by David Clarke, Gary Connelly and Eoghan O'Connor. It is a group messenger app. Users can create a username and password and send private messages or send out a status in the form of a broadcast message for anyone to see. The clients can send a message to the server and the server sends it back out. The server is in a virtual machine in Google Cloud.

## System Requirements

### Purpose
The purpose of the System Requirements document is to specify the overall system requirements that will govern the development and implementation of the system.  The document will also establish initial security, training, capacity and system architecture requirements, as well as, system acceptance criteria agreed upon be the project sponsor and key stakeholders.

### Major System Conditions
- System uses eclipse
- System uses a virtual machine for the server
- System requires normal internet connection

### System Interface

System uses JFrame Java Platform that adds support for the JFC/Swing component architecture
